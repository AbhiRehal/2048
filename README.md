# 2048

Please find the game [here](https://abhirehal.github.io/2048/)

This is my attempt at recreating the popular game 2048. The aim of the game is to achieve the 2048 tile by combining tiles which add up to 2048. The player can swipe in 4 directions; up, down, left and right and this will shift all the tiles into that direction and adds all tiles which have the same value in a collision, with the highest priority being on the tiles closest to the input direction.

Trying gitbash command line.
